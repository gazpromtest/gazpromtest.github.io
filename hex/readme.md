I have never made a turn-based or hexagon-based game before, so I decided to try it out. Using rules similar to Risk, four players compete for dominance of the game board. When the game starts, you can choose how many of the players will be under human control. The rest are controlled by the AI. You can select 0 humans if you want to just watch the AI play itself.

You can view the JavaScript source and then use a JavaScript "beautifier" to make it legible. I don't have the original source code available online, but that should be close to the same thing.
